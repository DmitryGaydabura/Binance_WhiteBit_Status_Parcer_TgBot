This is a simple application, based on several Open-Sourse API's:
1. Binance API
2. WhiteBit API
3. Telegram Bots API

This application was originally developed for simple arbitrage status check, but I've continued to add features and improvements since then.

The program is written in Java and requires a compiler with Java 11 support. The only dependencies needed are included in pom.xml file in this repository.
